Questions on Lab 5 - 
Do I need to set a file path for specific location for lab 5?
do so for testing and then leave it in. I will change it for testing.

For lab5, can I pass the length along with the Student[] to Statistics?
Otherwise, how should we be keeping track of the used space in the array?
you create an array of size 40.
you populate only the index elements based on # of records in file.
 - 15 records - 15 student objects - last 25 object in student array are null values - that's what you test for.
	if(stu[i]!=null)

Do we have to pass the student array to the readFile function?I just have readFile create the array and return it.
Yes please pass the reference into readFile().

No UI class needed for this lab.
Pl. make sure you test with different # of rows in file.

What if rowcount > 40.
Ignore anything > 40.

Pl. do not create a new array based on # of records in file.
Create an array of size 40.

can i create a static variable to keep track of student count.

for class diagram shld pkgs be included - if you can with simple dotted rectangles - not required.
