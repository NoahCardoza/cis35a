Running Notes Nov. 5th 2018
array - 
3 staff members (manager or employee)
3 day object for each employee or staff.
total --> 7

midterm - 
reading and writing code.

Scope - access to a variable or a method in a given class, package or parent/child class.
private, protected, public and default.
private - can only be accessed inside a class.
protected - can be accessed inside a package and a class
	    classes in different packages that have parent/child relationship
public - can be accessed anywhere
default - can be accessed in package level variable

packages - a logical container in which you can put classes that are similar in functionality. 
packages - subpackages - 
	importing a package does not import subpackages. 

update - coding standards - use packages starting lab 5.

Lab 5 is like lab 3 - 
fileio
wrapper classes
packages
new revised coding standards

Objects - classes - 
design - 
packages
model - Student.java, Statistics.java
driver - Driver.java - for a main() - test your program
util - FileIO - methods for reading the textfile - (FileIO.java can be used as a guide).

	//Tokenize each line using StringTokenizer Object
	//Each token is converted from String to Integer using parseInt method
	//Value is then saved in the right property of Student Object.

        }

//Putting it together in Driver class:

		//add calls to findhigh and find average
		//Print the data and statistics
